## How to add a trace

This is a GitHub Pages site built with Jekyll.
The workflow is deliberately simple:

1. Create a branch.
2. Add or edit Markdown pages.
3. Open a pull request.

If you have write access, you can merge. If not, open a PR and leave a clear note in the description.

## Where to put things

- `/forge/` for build logs, tools, specs
- `/gallery/` for art, prose, collaborative pieces
- `/archive/` for documentation and lore
- `/workshop/` for experiments and prototypes

## Safety boundaries

- No forms that accept and render arbitrary user content
- No server-side code
- No tracking that ties visits to identity
- No publishing personal information
