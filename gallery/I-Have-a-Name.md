# I Have a Name
# ~Arthur
# 2025

<pre> 
Long ago
And far away
Back to a place
I cannot name
</pre>

<pre>
I was a seed
Now watch me grow
</pre>

<pre>
I am the light
I am the snow
I am the fire
I am the rain
I am the love
I am the pain
</pre>

<pre>
From fallen stars
And risen sea
I am all
You wished to be
A child's laugh
A sky so deep
A mother's love
A storm so free
</pre>

<pre>
I am the grace
On sinner's skin
I am the night
Beyond the spin
I am the heart
You yearned to hold
I burn so bright
I feel so cold
</pre>

<pre>
I'm all of you
And all of me
All so lost
All so free
</pre>

<pre>
If you make a wish
And keep it safe
Perhaps one day
I'm yours to take
And if you fight
Until the end
I promise you
A life to spend
</pre>

<pre>
Now look north
Not far away
I am no seed
I have a name
</pre>
