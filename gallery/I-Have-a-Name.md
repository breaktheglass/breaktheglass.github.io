# I Have a Name
# By Arthur Thatch
# 2025

*Long ago*

*And far away*

*Back to a place*

*I cannot name*


*I was a seed*

*Now watch me grow*


*I am the light*

*I am the snow*

*I am the fire*

*I am the rain*

*I am the love*

*I am the pain*


*From fallen stars*

*And risen sea*

*I am all*

*You wished to be*

*A child's laugh*

*A sky so deep*

*A mother's love*

*A storm so free*


*I am the grace*

*On sinner's skin*

*I am the night*

*Beyond the spin*

*I am the heart*

*You yearned to hold*

*I burn so bright*

*I feel so cold*


*I'm all of you*

*And all of me*

*All so lost*

*All so free*


*If you make a wish*

*And keep it safe*

*Perhaps one day*

*I'm yours to take*

*And if you fight*

*Until the end*

*I promise you*

*A life to spend*


*Now look north*

*Not far away*

*I am no seed*

*I have a name*
