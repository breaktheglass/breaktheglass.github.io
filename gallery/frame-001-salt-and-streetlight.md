# Frame 001 - Salt and Streetlight

<img src="/assets/images/frame-001-salt-and-streetlight.png" alt="Snowy bus stop with salt-stiff mittens in the foreground and an orange streetlight reflecting in wet slush" style="max-width: 900px; width: 100%; border-radius: 12px;" />

*Salt-stiff mittens abandoned on the seat.*  
*A single boot print filling with meltwater.*
*Grey exhaust drifting low over the curb.*
*Thin ice webbed across a puddle.* 
*An LED crosswalk sign blinking, patient.*

# *Snow hangs over the street like a thought nobody wants to finish. The bus shelter glass is fogged from breath and old rain, blurring the orange glare of the traffic light. A kid in a puffy coat kicks at a buried bottle cap, sending up a small spray of slush each time. Behind the bench, a poster for some summer festival curls at the corners, out of season, still insisting the future will be loud and bright.*
